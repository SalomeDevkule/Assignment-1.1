There are 2 challenges of big data-
storage 
processing

Hadoop can overcome the above mentioned challenges as hadoop distributed file system(HDFS) manages the storage and 
map reduce manages the processing. Also Hadoop works in automated distributed computing environment helping for faster processing. 

Working of hadoop
With hdfs the data is written once on the server and subsequently read and re-used many times.
And MapReduce mainly works in breaking down the data into smaller manageable pieces and then processing the data in parallel
on the distributed cluster and then combine the result.
